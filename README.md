# spotijudge - Your Personal Music Taste Critic

A retro-styled web application that analyzes your Spotify listening habits through the lens of Anthony Fantano (theneedledrop). Connect your Spotify account to get your music taste "reviewed" with a custom scoring algorithm that judges your musical choices across multiple factors.

## Features

- **Spotify OAuth Integration**: Secure authentication with Spotify Web API
- **Advanced Music Analysis**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm analyzing:
  - Genre diversity and "coolness" factor (70+ genres classified)
  - Artist and track popularity metrics
  - Follower count tiers
  - Content explicitness
- **Retro Gaming Interface**: Pixel-art inspired UI with interactive dialogue system
- **Real-time Track Reviews**: Cycle through your top 20 tracks with individual scoring
- **Session-based Navigation**: Persistent state management for seamless browsing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python 3.7+, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **API**: Spotify Web API (OAuth 2.0)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Google Fonts (Press Start 2P)
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions for state persistence

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Users authenticate via Spotify OAuth
2. **Data Collection**: App fetches user's top 20 tracks and detailed artist information
3. **Scoring Algorithm**: Each track receives a "cool score" based on:
   - **Genre Bonus**: +50 points for "cool" genres (metal, experimental, underground hip-hop, etc.)
   - **Popularity Scaling**: Lower popularity = higher score (rewards discovering underground music)
   - **Artist Followers**: Fewer followers = bonus points (supports smaller artists)
   - **Track Popularity**: Less mainstream tracks score higher
   - **Explicit Content**: +5 point bonus
4. **Interactive Review**: Navigate through tracks with Fantano-inspired commentary
5. **Overall Score**: Calculate average "coolness" across all tracks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Spotify account (free or premium)
- Spotify Developer App credentials

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/larsssmoatsss/spotijudge.git
   cd spotijudge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Spotify Developer App**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new app
   - Add `http://localhost:5000/callback` to Redirect URIs
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

4. **Configure credentials**
   - Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`
   - Fill in your Spotify API credentials:
   ```json
   {
       "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
       "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here", 
       "SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:5000/callback"
   }
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Scoring System

The "cool score" algorithm evaluates tracks on multiple criteria:

### Genre Classification
70+ "cool" genres including:
- **Metal variants**: deathcore, black metal, doom metal, mathcore
- **Electronic**: IDM, breakcore, dark ambient, industrial
- **Hip-hop**: experimental hip hop, underground rap, horrorcore
- **Rock/Punk**: post-hardcore, shoegaze, noise rock, math rock
- **Jazz/Soul**: jazz fusion, alternative R&B
- **And many more underground/experimental genres**

### Scoring Breakdown
- **Genre Bonus**: 50 points for tracks in "cool" genres
- **Artist Popularity**: 2-18 points (inverse scale - less popular = more points)
- **Follower Count**: 6-16 points (supports smaller artists)
- **Track Popularity**: 1-11 points (underground tracks favored)
- **Explicit Content**: 5 point bonus
- **Maximum Score**: 100 points per track

## Design Features

- **Retro Gaming Aesthetic**: Inspired by classic RPG dialogue systems
- **Custom Character**: Green-tinted Anthony Fantano sprite
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable dialogue progression with hover effects
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Typography**: Press Start 2P font for authentic retro feel
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with Spotify green accents (#1db954)
